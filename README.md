## ✨ Features

- Display battery level for:
  - Both central and peripheral sides of split keyboards
  - Multiple keyboards simultaneously
- Record battery level history and display in a graph
- Multi-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux (limited, see [here](#limitations-on-linux) for details)
- Display battery status on the system tray:
  - macOS: configurable role labels, battery icons, percentages, and the application icon (inspired by [ZMK Battery Bar](https://github.com/itouuuuuuuuu/zmk-battery-bar))
  - Windows: up to three ordered battery progress indicators using separate configurable low/high color thresholds
  - Linux: battery-level tray indicators are not currently available
- (Options)
  - Push notifications when
    - Keyboard battery level reaches / drops below a certain threshold
    - Keyboard is connected/disconnected
  - Auto start at login
  - Switch between light and dark themes

## Installation

### Install with command

#### Windows

```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kot149/zmk-battery-center/main/scripts/install_win.ps1')"
```
[View install script](scripts/install_win.ps1)

This requires admin privileges. If you don't have admin privileges, manually install with `*-setup.exe` in [Releases](https://github.com/kot149/zmk-battery-center/releases).

#### macOS

##### Using Homebrew

```sh
brew tap kot149/tap
brew trust --cask kot149/tap/zmk-battery-center
brew install --cask kot149/tap/zmk-battery-center
```

> **Note:** The app may be blocked from opening as is not code-signed. To allow it, either:
> - Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
> - Or run the following command in Terminal:
>   ```sh
>   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/zmk-battery-center.app
>   ```

##### Using the install script

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kot149/zmk-battery-center/main/scripts/install_mac.sh | bash
```
[View install script](scripts/install_mac.sh)

#### Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kot149/zmk-battery-center/main/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash
```
[View install script](scripts/install_linux.sh)

You will be prompted to select the package format from AppImage, .deb, or .rpm.
AppImage installs to `~/.local/bin/zmk-battery-center.AppImage`. Debian and RPM packages install system-wide via `sudo` and usually add a desktop entry.

### Install manually
Download the binary/installer and install manually from [Releases](https://github.com/kot149/zmk-battery-center/releases).

If you worry about security, you can build the app yourself from source code. See [development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for more details.

## Limitations on Linux

While this app is also released for Linux, it is not much tested, as the author does not regularly use Linux desktop environment.
Feel free to report any issues you find on Linux, but I cannot guarantee that I can fix them.

Also there are some limitations specifically on Linux:
- The app may not appear around the system tray icon. Enable `Manual window positioning` (see [Window position is misaligned](#window-position-is-misaligned)) to place the window where you want it.
- Tray icon left-click behavior depends on the SNI host (the desktop's tray implementation). On Ubuntu GNOME with the default `ubuntu-appindicators` extension, single left-click opens the context menu and **double-click** is required to toggle the window. On hosts that fully implement the SNI `Activate` method (e.g. KDE Plasma, sway/waybar), single left-click should toggle the window directly. Use the `Show` menu item as a universal fallback.
- The app never disconnects the devices internally because call of `disconnect_device()` API on Linux causes OS-level disconnection. Unused connections might remain after the app exits.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot open the app on macOS

On macOS, the app is blocked from opening as it is not signed. Allow the app to open by either:
- Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Security and click `Open Anyway`.
- Or, run the following command in the terminal to remove the app from quarantine:
  ```sh
  sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/zmk-battery-center.app
  ```
  Typically it's located at `/Applications/zmk-battery-center.app`, but change it to the actual path if it's not there.

### My keyboard does not show up / Peripheral side battery level is not displayed

- Ensure your keyboard is connected to your computer via Bluetooth.
- Confirm your keyboard firmware includes the following ZMK configuration options:
  ```kconfig
  CONFIG_BT_BAS=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORTING=y

  # For split keyboards:
  CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_FETCHING=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_PROXY=y
  ```
  See the ZMK Documentation [about Bluetooth](https://zmk.dev/docs/config/system#bluetooth) and [about battery](https://zmk.dev/docs/config/battery) for more details.
- On macOS, make sure Bluetooth permission is granted to the app.

### Window position is misaligned

Window position may be misaligned if the OS has problems handling multiple monitors or you are using vertical taskbar on Windows.

You can manually move the window to the correct position to address this issue.

1. Right click the tray icon
2. Click `Control` > `Manual window positioning` in the menu
3. Now you can grab the top of the window to move it to any position you like

## Development

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for environment setup, build commands, and running tests.
